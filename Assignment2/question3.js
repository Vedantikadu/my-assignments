function findTax(salary) {
    let tax = 0;

    switch (true) {
        case (salary > 0 && salary <= 500000):
            tax = 0;
            break;

        case (salary > 500000 && salary <= 1000000):
            tax = salary * 0.10;
            break;

        case (salary > 1000000 && salary <= 1500000):
            tax = salary * 0.20;
